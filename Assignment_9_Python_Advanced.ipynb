The default encoding of characters in Python is UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit).ASCII is really a 7-bit character set; it is mapped to 8-bit bytes by setting the high bit to zero. Thus, ASCII characters are unchanged in UTF-8. A non-zero high bit indicates that a character composed of multiple bytes."
