You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x.\n",

Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside another class. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This type of relationship is known as Has-A Relation."
